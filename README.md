# chronology

Chronology, written by Bram Adams of OthersideAI, is a library that enables users of OpenAI's GPT-3 language model to more easily build complex language-powered applications. It provides a simple and intuitive interface for working with GPT-3.

We built this at OthersideAI to help mitigate some of the monotonous work we had to do when developing with GPT-3. Our library has the following features:

- Asynchronously call GPT-3, enabling multiple prompts to generate at the same time
- Easy creation and modification of prompts
- Chain prompts together, feeding output from one or multiple prompts into another prompt, allowing for highly-complex systems to be built quickly

We built this library to be as intuitive as possible. There are no complicated concepts to master.

We are in the process of adding more features, and would love to hear what you think. You can get in touch with us at info@othersideai.com

# installation

chronology is hosted on PyPI.

Chronology is supported on Python 3.5 and above.

To install chronology:

pip install chronology

# usage

To use chronology, you must

# real-world applications

Chronology is the backbone of OthersideAI. We use it to chain prompt calls and asyncronously call GPT-3. Our application is highly complex, and has many steps. Chronology allows us to parallelize those steps, significantly cutting down the time it takes to generate an email.

We are also using Chronology to power other internal (shhhhhh) projects. We will be sharing more about these soon!
